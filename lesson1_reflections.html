      Bugs sometimes hard to find in a long programming scripts.
    </p>
    <p>With diff the differences could be picked out easily.</p>
    <p>The bugs always laying in the differences.</p>
    <p>Keeping the history versions of my code could make it possible to reuse or rewrite the code.</p>
    <p>Manual Commit.</p>
    <p>It is more flexible to make a commit manually. One can decide when to make a logical or reasonable commit.</p>
    <p>Auto saving just save time, but it is hard to control when the commit would have been made.</p>
    <p>For a functional project, like a web page, all the files are working together.</p>
    <p>So it's very important to make commits comprise all the files involved in the project.</p>
    <p>This method could make very single commit a fully working version of this project.</p>
    <p>Git log command can reveal all the commits at a time. When the commit made, what was changed in it, who made this, more importantly, we can have the commit ID in the log.</p>
    <p>Git diff can compare two commits line by line. It's easy to find any revisions with git diff.</p>
    <p>When I finish a reliable or stable version of project, a commit have to be made to keep all the files being control.</p>
    <p>Then I can try out some new ideas without concern of making my code a mess.</p>
    <p>If it became a mess, a stable commit could be checkout easily! Then everything goes fine!</p>
    <p>Now I have my git and bash configured. I'd like to try git a lot for my HTML and CSS files!</p>
    <p>I'm going to start a new project for my blog comprise learning notes and portfolios and a interactive resume!</p>
    <p>At least but not last, I want to put my .vimrc to git and make it assessable anywhere!</p>
    <p>When I initiate a repository, git will take over the version or any changing or my files.</p>
    <p>I'm able to save the desired files as the initiate commit then follow up its changes.</p>
