      1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    </h1>
    <p>
      As a repository is initialized, git configures that directory for later management.
      A hidden file .git is created in repository to store meta data of this repository.
    </p>
    
    <h1>
      2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Working directory containing all files that are needed or not needed for the repository. The staging area is where to put files desired in the repository. The staging area is like a template warehouse to put in or take out files without affecting the repository if any file reset happened.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Put every changes into staging area then check all the changes are made correctly then commit.
    </p>
    <h1>
      What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    </h1>
    <p>
      When I want to add a experimental function to the project, it is really helpful to make a branch to test it. Otherwise making the new function directly to master branch would probably damage the production code.
    </p>
    <h1>
      How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Since a project might have several branches, the visualized branch structure could help people to understand the whole project more clearly.
    </p>
    <h1>
      Why reachability is important?
    </h1>
    <p>
      If a not lasted commit is checkout, the branch will enter a "Detached Head" mode. Any changes in the checkout commit would disappear until you make a new branch on it.
    </p>
    <h1>
      What is the result of merging two branches together? Why do we represent it in the diagram the way we do?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Merging two branches together will merge all their commits as one branch, and those commits will be sorted by time when they were created.
      In a branches diagram it is much more clear to figure out the structure of the whole project. It could be more convenience to merge branches without mistake.
    </p>
    <h1>
      What are the pros and cons of Gitâ€™s automatic merging vs. always doing merges manually?
    </h1>
    Automatic merging is really convenient to use to merge 2 branches. But when a conflict happens, git couldn't figure out how to deal with the conflicting contents, since the changes might come from different contributer or of the different ideas of the same programmer. In such case manually merge could help.
