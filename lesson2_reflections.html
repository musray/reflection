      1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
    </h1>
    <p>
      As a repository is initialized, git configures that directory for later management.
      A hidden file .git is created in repository to store meta data of this repository.
    </p>

      2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Working directory containing all files that are needed or not needed for the repository. The staging area is where to put files desired in the repository. The staging area is like a template warehouse to put in or take out files without affecting the repository if any file reset happened.
    </p>
    <h1>
      3. How can you use the staging area to make sure you have one commit per logical change?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Put every changes into staging area then check all the changes are made correctly then commit.
    </p>
    <h1>
      What are some situations when branches would be helpful in keeping your history organized? How would branches help?
    </h1>
    <p>
      When I want to add a experimental function to the project, it is really helpful to make a branch to test it. Otherwise making the new function directly to master branch would probably damage the production code.
    </p>
    <h1>
      How do the diagrams help you visualize the branch structure?
    </h1>
    <p>
      Since a project might have several branches, the visualized branch structure could help people to understand the whole project more clearly.
