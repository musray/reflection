    1. What happens when you initialize a repository? Why do you need to do it?
  </h1>
  <p>
    As a repository is initialized, git configures that directory for later management.
    A hidden file .git is created in repository to store meta data of this reposotory.

    2. How is the staging area different from the working directory and the repository? What value do you think it offers?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Working directory containing all files that are needed or not needed for the reposotory. The staging area is where to put files desired in the repository. The staging area is like a template warehouse to put in or take out files without affecting the repository if any file reset happened.
