    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Like some open source softwares are not developed by single people, collaboration are very important in the software development process.
    In this case, make a Git repository online is much more easier for multi development process synchronized in a single project.
    Different developers can make their own branches in which different functions could be built at the same time.
    Then it is convenient to merge branches altogether on Github.
