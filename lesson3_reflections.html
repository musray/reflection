    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Since most of open source softwares are not developed by a single people, collaboration is very important in the software development process.
    Thus, make a Git repository online is much easier for multi development process in a single project.
    Different developers can make their own branches among which different functions could be built at the same time.
    Then it is convenient and accurate to merge branches altogether on Github.
