  <h1>
    When would you want to use a remote repository rather than keeping all your work local?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Since most of open source softwares are not developed by a single people, collaboration is very important in the software development process.
    Thus, make a Git repository online is much easier for multi development process in a single project.
    Different developers can make their own branches among which different functions could be built at the same time.
    Then it is convenient and accurate to merge branches altogether on Github.

  <h1>
    Why might you want to always pull changes manually rather than having Git automatically stay up-to-date with your remote repository?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Because I'd like to always know what it is like to pull to my local reposotory.

    Describe the differences between forks, clones, and branches. When would you use one instead of another?
  </h1>
  <p>
    Forks is a new concept for this lesson. It is a Github command for clone a Github repository to one's Github account directly on the air.
    It has nothing to do with the local repository.
    Clone command could both copy a repository from remote to local, or from local to local.
    Branches is only create a new branch based on current branch' commit locally.
